## 1. Overview 

V. Isualize, the stakeholder of this project and a highly experienced data analyst, has requested a summary DataFrame displaying various ride-sharing parameters based on City Type. This report will also exhibit a multiple-line chart of total fares for each city type that will complement the Dataframe.

## 2. Results

### 2.1. Rural cities

The blue line in the multiple-line chart signifies that the Rural cities receive the lowest fares among the three city types across the assessed timeframe. The number of rides is nearly five times less than the Suburban cities, which shows why the maximum total fare was only $500. 

### 2.2. Suburban cities

The red line indicates that the suburban cities lie second in revenue generation. It is now clear that the population is a huge contributor to the number of rides and thereby the revenue. We can also see that ride counts and the average Fare per driver are inversely proportional.

### 2.3. Urban cities

The yellow shows records of highest fares among the three city types with the higest total weekly fare recorded as $2500. However, this comes with a the lowest average fare per driver. 

## 3. Summary

From our analysis, we can conclude that choosing the right fare price can have a positive influence on the ride count. Lowering the Fare in Rural areas would encourage more riders. However, this might discourage the Drivers from offering rides as their ride-sharing opportunities are lower in this city type. Pyber could introduce incentives to new riders for a limited time to attract more riders from Rural areas. On verifying the success of the incentives program, Suburban cities can be introduced to the same idea. Eventually, the fare per ride would rise to match the fare per Driver in Rural and Suburban cities. In addition, the excess drivers in the Urban areas can be directed towards Rural areas to offer quicker servies to the riders.
